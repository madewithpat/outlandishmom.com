## I'm in love with **JAMStack**

It's really an awesome way to do websites. This site took a totaly of 10 minutes to scaffold out, and I have a CMS that's non-developer friendly, SSL with a cert from Let's Encrypt, and everything is being served from a CDN.

Oh, and did I mention the developer experience? It's downright *wonderful.*

Everything sits in a Git repository. The only thing served is the output of a build process, which is done at *author time*, not on the fly (\*ahem\* looking at you, WordPress). The front end is rendered via React, which means **I get a full featured React development environment**.

Is the scaffold perfect?

No.

Is there still plenty of set up to be done?

Sure.

But at the end of the day, I'll have an environment complete with linting, automated testing, and a hot reloading local server. All those things that make JavaScript such a joy.

Goodbye, WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, and every other overly complex CMS of yesteryear. Hello, Gatsby.
